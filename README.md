Resolved type error when user have not provided dat on profile. (None or Nonetype)
For example, I havn't updated my Bio section on Github profile. when i try to retrive bio section, it is giving me TypeError.
it it possible that user might not have updated many part of their profile. Hence, this kind of error can be handled by 'try and except', in advance.
